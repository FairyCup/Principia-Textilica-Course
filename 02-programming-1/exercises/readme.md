## *exercise_02_02* ##

1. Open the Mathematica Notebook inside the solutions folder.

2. Create a function of one variable. Example:

		fn[x_] := Sin[x] + Sin[2 x] / 2
	
3. Plot it using the various plot commands. Example:

		Plot[fn[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}]
		
4. Now create a function of two variables. Example:

		fn[x_, y_] := Sin[x] + Cos[2 y] / 2

4. Plot it using various 3D plot commands

		ContourPlot[fn[x, y], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, {y, 0, 2 Pi}]

5. Use the various headlines, sections and text style to add some information

6. Add the code to your repo, commit and push!
