\section{Principia Textilica}

\subsection{Context}

\subsection{Motivation}

Complexity:  a number of simple elements with simple behavioral rules can model a complex system.
(My background? Finding patterns in the real world to model and solve a problem, reduce complexity. For a handcraft/artsy approach: turn it around and start from the rules to create a pattern.)
Suitable for computational support. Applicable to a textile technique.

\subsection{Ideas}

For inspiration I looked at topics that have fascinated me for years: (include graphic(s))
-	Swarm Complexity (simple rules for every part create complex behavior)
-	Networks/Graphs
-	"Living" things (plants/fungi/insects/animals)
-	Macramé (Knotting), Dying, Painting on Fabric, Sewing, Felting

Since I tend to put a soul into everything that even remotely displays some sort of life, I decided to limit myself to techniques/topics that would support this idea.
Easy for the computational part: I decided to go with a simple swarm model, which means I have a number of individuals which are controlled by a set of rules concerning themselves and their environment (= the other members of the swarm).
How I would translate that into something textile, I was not so sure at first, but I started with a thread-based idea, where each thread is seen as an individual. Macramé and Embroidery were favored candidates.

\section{Code Implementation}
\subsection{The Pond/Fish tank}

I implemented a single swarm simulation very similar to the "Boids"-idea.
The simulation is in 2D and has 2 main elements: the tank and the fish.
The tank started out as rectangular, but I found a circle to be more aesthetically pleasing (softer, more natural shape) as well as more fitting for an embroidery hoop. The circle embodies the simple inside/outside-world that I need. The tank restricts the movement of the fish inside.
The fish swarm consists of individual fish that – exceptions are the color and the name – start out as equal clones. There are several more, but the most important fish parameters/properties are:
-	Size of field of view
-	Distance for avoiding other fish (Privacy)
-	Distance for following other fish (Company)
-	Speed for making turns
Each fish can be either harmless or predatory towards other fish.
There is no randomness in my program (again, except for the generation of colors).
-	If it is a predator or not.

Trial/Error runs? Unused parameters?
References/inspiration/ideas:
-	Boids (Flocking simulation)
-	Pattern Generation
-	Changing Pattern in something fix
First (implemented) sketched out idea:
School of fish in a tank/pond, 2D to reduce scope of work:
-	Boids – idea for behaviour: seek companionship, avoid predators, walls and companions that get too close (company, safety, privacy)
-	(explain some parameters to finetune behaviour, also predators no real danger, like the problems we run from – they won’t kill us, but starve us emotionally)
-	(explain main mechanism: finding the direction vector in each step, no randomness involved)
-	Other alterations/ playing with ideas: start with one fish that can spawn children (keep on moving or die after spawning)

Intermediate result:
-	Tracking positions in pixels : image with traces on picture (pixels, not lines)
-	Image with connecting lines (data = lines)

Role of Textiles in this?
-	Threads/knots as small part with defined behaviour (1. idea)
-	Errors over time, two tanks with same starting population grow apart (2. Idea, did not quite work, funny because with handcraft that happens : no identical pieces)
-	Connections to ancestors (3. Idea, without predators)
-	Connections to ancestors should limit the "life" of the  fish somehow (3. idea) : threads also limited, no infinite resource in real life, limited freedom?
-	-> include death somehow? Maybe the thread becomes limited depending on how close you were when your ancestor died : shorter thread?
-	New connections to fish you are close to for a longer time : frienships/partnerships (different color/weight?)
Textile finished piece:
-	Embroidery: pixelated image to threaded image (boring)
-	Connections to threaded image(series) (better? Development of generations)
-	Tree (knots/perls? = fish, length of edge is also determined by fish-bowl-movement) / graph : flexible
TODO: startled spreads with a delay ("reaction time")
