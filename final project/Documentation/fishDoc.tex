\section{Principia Textilica}

\subsection{Context}
In the course "Principia Textilica" we explored intersections of computational algorithms and textile craft, including pattern generation algorithms, weaving techniques, knot theory, hands-on experience with textile maschines, history lessons and more.
For the final project each student was encouraged to find a subject to implement some of the methods and techniques we got to see during the course.

\subsection{Motivation}

I study Computer Science and Media, which means my background is more algorithmic/technical than art-related.
Nevertheless I am familiar with a few textile techniques such as knotting (Macramé), weaving, sewing, felting and embroidery.\\
For inspiration I looked at two topics that have fascinated me for years: Modeling "Living" Things (plants/fungi/insects/animals) and complexity.\\
Complexity is often mistaken for complicatedness because the result looks complicated.
However, the system that produces a complex result is itself very simple. It consists of a certain number of elements and a few elemantary rules which are applied to those elements.\\
My goal was to use both, complexity and modeling simple "life", to create a (textile) pattern.

\section{Idea}

\subsection{The Pond/Fish Tank}
I decided to go with a swarm model, which means I have a number of individuals which are controlled by a set of rules concerning themselves, their dynamic environment (e.g. the other members of the swarm) and their static environment (e.g. boundaries of the tank).
The metaphor I chose was a school of fish moving around in a pond or glass tank.

The desired pattern would be generated by the movements of the individuals. I wanted to start with the rules and continuously adapt them depending on the outcome.\\
I did not settle for a specific textile technique, at this point I only thought about assigning each of the individuals a thread. With this premise in mind, favourable textile techniques were embroidery and knotting.


\subsection{Rules}

My fish program is in 2D and has two main elements: the tank and the fish.\\

The tank started out as rectangular, but I found a circle to be more aesthetically pleasing as well as more fitting for an embroidery hoop. The circle embodies the simple inside/outside world that I need.

The swarm rules below share some similarities with the "Boids" program by Craig Reynolds [TODO ref], he developed an agent-based algorithm to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds.\\

The behaviour of the fish is mainly determined by four principles:\\
I Company - Each fish will follow other fish.\\
II Privacy - Each fish needs a minimum of private space.\\
III Security- Each (non-predatory) fish will avoid any predators.\\
IV Boundary- Each fish will stay inside the tank.\\

There is no randomness in my program (except for movement-independent parameters of each fish such as the color). [TODO check for id?]

\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Algorithm} 

- set up tank and starter fish swarm
- update loop:
-- for each fish: determine new direction (depends on tank and neighbors)
-- for each fish: move in new direction

There are several more, but the most important fish parameters/properties are:
-	Size of field of view
-	Distance for avoiding other fish (Privacy)
-	Distance for following other fish (Company)
-	Speed for making turns
Each fish can be either harmless or predatory towards other fish.

-	If it is a predator or not.

\subsection{Additional Code (Samples)}
- using Processing
- methods for changing views (via key press)
- methods for saving images and log file
- method to pause

\section{Textile Implementation}

\subsection{Preparation?}
How I would translate that into something textile, I was not so sure at first, but I started with a thread-based idea, where each thread is seen as an individual. Macramé and Embroidery were favored candidates.

\subsection{}
tank:
cx,cy,radius: 300.0 300.0 300.0
starter fish: 1
maxGenerations 7
maxChildren 2
spawnTime 4500ms
turnSpeed 0.0051/ms
follow/avoid 0.5/0.5
wall/neighbor 0.9/0.1

fish:
0 g:0 born 300.0 300.0 : 50 50 c:

In the first trial I scaled the positions down to fit a 100 by 100 grid. [foto fabric].
For 7 generations of fish, each having 2 children I need 2^7 threads (128). I used cotton wool thread, itself already containing 8 (2^3) sub-threads, for the piece I needes 16 strings of this cotton wool - which is quite thick. I tried to fit it through one "grid point" - even when I succeeded the accuracy of the grid was physically compromised, so I decided to at least ... for the first (or even the second) generation. The start point for the fish is 50/50, after dividing the thick cord into 4 subchords à 4 strings the start points are 51/50, 49/50, 50/49, 50/51.

Trial/Error runs? Unused parameters?

First (implemented) sketched out idea:

-	(explain main mechanism: finding the direction vector in each step, no randomness involved)
-	Other alterations/ playing with ideas: start with one fish that can spawn children (keep on moving or die after spawning)

Intermediate result:
-	Tracking positions in pixels : image with traces on picture (pixels, not lines)
-	Image with connecting lines (data = lines)

Role of Textiles in this?
-	Threads/knots as small part with defined behaviour (1. idea)
-	Errors over time, two tanks with same starting population grow apart (2. Idea, did not quite work, funny because with handcraft that happens : no identical pieces)
-	Connections to ancestors (3. Idea, without predators)
-	Connections to ancestors should limit the "life" of the  fish somehow (3. idea) : threads also limited, no infinite resource in real life, limited freedom?
-	-> include death somehow? Maybe the thread becomes limited depending on how close you were when your ancestor died : shorter thread?
-	New connections to fish you are close to for a longer time : frienships/partnerships (different color/weight?)
Textile finished piece:
-	Embroidery: pixelated image to threaded image (boring)
-	Connections to threaded image(series) (better? Development of generations)
-	Tree (knots/perls? = fish, length of edge is also determined by fish-bowl-movement) / graph : flexible
